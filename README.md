# Extensible Compression Evaluation Framework

## Rationale

I would like to build a fast and besides all extensible compression evalution framework. The main motivation is to have a tool that would allow me to automatically evaluate a set of compression algorithms over a given range of parameters in a sequence and find those that fit best the specified criteria, be it compression or decompression speed, used memory, compression ratio etc.
